A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. It's like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. In addition, it's one of the best ways to express your personality, experience, and capabilities.
The project aims to design and develop a personal portfolio website using the Bootstrap framework. The website will consist of several key sections, including Home, About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact. 
The project will follow a structured approach, starting with planning and research to define the purpose and goals of the website. The content gathering will involve preparing and organizing the information for each section, such as the bio for the Home page, background and experiences for the About page, skills for the Skills page, and project details for the Portfolio page. The necessary contact information will also be collected for the Contact page.
Bootstrap will be set up to serve as the frontend framework for the project, allowing for a responsive and mobile-friendly design. The website will be implemented section by section, starting with the Home page, About page, Skills page, Portfolio page, and concluding with the Contact page.
